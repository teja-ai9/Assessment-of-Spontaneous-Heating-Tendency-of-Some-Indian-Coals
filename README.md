# Assessment-of-Spontaneous-Heating-Tendency-of-Some-Indian-Coals
Spontaneous combustion of coal is an important problem in mining and storage, in terms of both safety and economics. This is because coal reacts with oxygen in the air and an exothermic reaction occurs, even in ambient conditions. This auto- oxidation of coal is a complex physico-chemical process which is accompanied by the absorption of oxygen, formation of coal oxygen complexes and their decomposition leading to the liberation of heat. The project aims to assess various parameters of coal with the spontaneous heating tendency of coal and develop a statistical risk analysis using established regression models. Four insitu coal samples for the project were collected:7 three from Singareni Collieries Company Ltd. (SCCL) and one from Eastern Coalfields Limited (ECL). The project deals with determination of spontaneous heating susceptibility of coal samples by experimental techniques.
